# 05-Space-Shooter
This is my submission for the space shooter project for my Game Tech class! :)

In this simple game, you can move your rocket ship around and shoot at some rogue and randomly placed alien enemies. There's not much to it but that! 

I have added music to the background of my game, so please turn your sound on! Here is where I downloaded my sound from:

Update 1.1 : Audio actually isn't working! Audio has been taken out to allow game to run.

Update 1.2 Audio has been added! Please turn your computer sound on!
